<p style="color: darkgreen">'Hellbound with You' is a thrilling fantasy slash fictional slash romance novels about
  Alexander Qinn and Abigail Lee who are both the protagonists.This is a story of how their liking to each other
  matures into love. Love where their sole existence is futile if they dont have each other. Love where breathing isn't
  as important as giving thought to each other, and catching a glimpse of each other's smile or even laughter.
  However, this is only after 200 chapters in a 924-chapter book.</p>
<p style="color: orangered">"I love you despite the danger signs"</p>

<p style="color: blueviolet">Alexander Qinn is a man of mystery. He has never loved and he will never love. Describing him as attractive would be
a definite understatement. He is every woman's dream but he never dreams. Alex has only one simple rule. "You may love
me but never ask me to love you back" Truth is, Alexander Qinn isn't just your average man. He is in fact a Vampire.
He is feared by all other vampire and even the royal family because he is the only Half-vampire and he is immortal.
Only one exists.Legends and tales of his rogue murders and quests to conquer nations were believed to only be myths.
Having lived for centuries, he lost his humanity, life became boring and he desired to die just like all the nations
he conquered which came to pass. There was only one way to kill him... "A dagger through the heart by his beloved, a
woman pure of heart, mind, body and soul. The witches had predicted it centuries before and they were never wrong.</p>
<p style="color: crimson">He made a contract with Abigail. Just for a month she was ato be his contractual girlfriend. How hard could that be?
He only gave her two simple rules, 'Not to expect him to love her' and 'Never get home past twilight'...yeah, home.
Abigail had to move in with him since it was part of the terms of the contract.He wondered how this innocent little
lamb managed to get away with disrespecting him. Did she not know who he was? Did she not fear him? Alex cold dominant
aura did not only actually scare Abi,but it gave her hope that he could one day be more human or at least show emotions
Alexander Qinn did not know how or when this little lamb did it but soon enough he was smitten, hooked even. Her
innocence itself made him realise she wasn't like other women he had been with. No. Nada! She was different and maybe,
just maybe he would change just for her...</p>

<h3>#Abigail Lee-</h3>

<p style="color:blueviolet ">Abigail Lee is an ordinary young woman, 23 years of age. She had lived an ordinary life since birth with her parents
and grandparents. Her mother was diagnosed with stage four brain tumour when she was 18 and died after he second
surgery. Five years later, Abi was diagnosed with the same illness her mother had and she had only a year left t live.
She therefore never bothered dating or ever falling in love for the fear of causing her beloved pain when he finally
lost her. On many nights she would hear her father crying over her mother's death and did not want to burden anyone else
with the sorrow of her inevitable departure.Throughout high school and university, many men had shown interest in pure
little Abi and not once did she give them the time of day. This always remained a shock to Abi's best friend, Kelly,
little miss rich celebrity heir to her father's company. Kelly was beautiful and well acquainted with men, and sometimes
had a knack to beat up a few... She did not understand Abi's blatant ignorance to love and relationships since she did
not know of her illness too.</p>
<p style="color: crimson">Abi was happy, elated even, to make the contract with Alexander Qinn. It was perfect for her. She would finally
experience what it felt like to love someone and not have to be loved back. She would fall hard for this arrogant,
possessive bastard. She knew it! However, considering she only had a year left to live,she too had her own terms for the
contract. She wrote a list of all the things she wanted to do with her boyfriend before she died. These cheesy little
things managed to weaken the chains that caged Alex's cold heart and it began to beat. It beat only for her. His
innocent little lamb.</p>
