<p style="color: darkgreen">Well interestingly... It's actually not as hard as I'd thought it would be. I've learnt
  about elements, attributes and how to autocomplete tags using the tab key. Looking forward to learning more in the
  next three months. Yay! </p>

<h3 style="color: crimson">First time going home alone, how do you feel bout that?...</h3>

<p style="color: darkgreen">So, honestly I'm a little freaked out. You know, back in high school I never really
  travelled to school by myself cause mom and dad always drove me there. This being my first time on the streets of
  Nairobi alone actually feels like Déjà vu. There's one time I had a dentist's appointment and I had to take the bus
  all the way to Belle view on my own. I got there safely, but I started panicking after I alighted the bus and I
  seriously thought I was lost. Mom was just across the road watching me, but I was so scared I couldn't see her... I did
  eventually and all's well that ends well, here I am today.</p>
<p style="color:orangered">Here's to hoping that never recurs, especially not today. I just need to find Tom Mboya Str.
  How hard can that be? So help me God...</p>

<h3 style="color: crimson">What to do when boredom strikes?...</h3>
<p style="color: darkgreen">Easy, strike back. Duh!!!</p>
<p style="color: orangered">Personally, I prefer reading novels. Favourite guilty pleasure of all time. Genre!
  Well, let's just say I'm a normal teenager at least. I basically like to read Sci-fi, romance and fantasy. But mom
  thinks I should read more realistic things and dad wants me to read motivation books. Like, one he just bought me
  called Atomic Habits. I say, let's broaden my knowledge then.With knowledge comes right.</p>
